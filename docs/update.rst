Updating *neurotic*
===================

The recommended method of updating *neurotic* depends on the original method of
installation.

If you are unsure what method you used, updating using ``conda`` or ``pip`` is
likely to work. Standalone installers may be safe too, though this could lead
to having multiple version installed simultaneously.

Updating with Standalone Installers
-----------------------------------

If you previously installed *neurotic* using a standalone installer, you may
install a newer version using another installer, either into a different
directory or by first uninstalling the old version. Installers can be
downloaded from the GitHub Releases page:

    `ðŸ‘‰ Download installers here (listed under "Assets") ðŸ‘ˆ`__

    __ `GitHub Releases`_

Alternatively, if a new installer is not currently available for your platform,
or if you would just like a much faster method, you may use the command line
tools provided by the installer (via the "Anaconda Prompt" on Windows, or the
Terminal on macOS and Linux)::

    conda update -c conda-forge neurotic

.. _updating-conda:
