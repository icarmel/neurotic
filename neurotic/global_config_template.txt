# --- neurotic global config --------------------------------------------------
# Use this file to configure the way neurotic behaves. This file uses the TOML
# format.

[defaults]
# When the app is launched, the following customizable defaults are used unless
# overridden by command line arguments. Example uses include:
#   - Uncomment the "file" parameter and insert the path to your favorite
#     metadata file so that it always opens automatically
#   - Uncomment the "lazy" parameter and set it to false to always disable fast
#     loading, ensuring that expensive procedures like spike detection and
#     filtering are performed by default
# To open the example metadata file by default, either leave the "file"
# parameter commented or set it to "example". To initially select the first
# dataset in the file, either leave the "dataset" parameter commented or set it
# to "none".

# file = "example"
# dataset = "none"
# debug = false
# lazy = true
# thick_traces = false
# show_datetime = false
# ui_scale = "medium"
# theme = "light"
